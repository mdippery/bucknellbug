# BucknellBug

**BucknellBug** is a program for checking the current weather conditions at
Bucknell University, Lewisburg, PA, as reported by Bucknell's
[weather station][station].

## Release

Only v1.1 of BucknellBug for Mac was released. That version is not
represented in this repository, as it was originally tracked in a Subversion
repository; the source code for the released version is [available][source]
on the BucknellBug homepage. The version represented in this repository,
slated to be v2.1, was never released publicly, but you can build and run it
yourself -- the current code works fine. However...

## Status

BucknellBug no longer seems to be functional; as of 10/21/2013, it appears
that the [weather station's][station] data feed has not been updated since
4/19/2013, and it seems unlikely to the author that the weather station will
be brought back online. This repository is mainly present for archival and
educational purposes.
