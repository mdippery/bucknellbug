# BucknellBug

**BucknellBug** is a program for checking the current weather conditions at
Bucknell University, Lewisburg, PA, as reported by Bucknell's
[weather station][station].

## Release

Only v1.1 of BucknellBug for Mac was released. That version is not
represented in the master branch of this repository, as it was originally
tracked in a Subversion repository; the source code for the released version is
[available][source] on the BucknellBug homepage, and is marked by the `v1.1`
tag in this repository.

The version represented in this repository, slated to be v2.1, was never
released publicly, but you can build and run it yourself -- the current code
works fine. However...

## Status

BucknellBug is longer functional. According to the [weather station
website][weather], on April 8th, 2013, an electrical surge knocked out the
service, and as of October 23rd, 2014, it has yet to be restored. This
repository is mainly present for archival and educational purposes, although
work is planned to rewrite BucknellBug to work with the [Dark Sky API][sky]
instead.
