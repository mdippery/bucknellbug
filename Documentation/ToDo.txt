TO DO:

Note that these items are in no particular order of importance.

* Implement preferences for Growl use, time interval
* Better interface than Dock menu
    * Maybe a daemon with a borderless, transparent window?
* Rising/falling tag for pressure (store old pressure and compare)
* Refresh in Dock menu
    * Can come into play if new interface is designed
* Develop an algorithm to set the timer to three minutes or so after the
  hour, so that weather is always checked around the time a new feed is
  posted.
* Develop better way to handle the build number automatically
    * A good way would be a script that bumps the build number when release
      versions are build
        * If that's not possible, just bumping the build after ANY build
          would be fine.
